Two stocks NSE-Nifty and SGX-Nifty are traded at 2 different places. The price-time series of NSE and SGX follows a normal distribution. There is another stock INDIA.P. The price changes of NSE and INDIA.P move in the same way as NSE and SGX.

The correlation between NSE and SGX is same as between NSE and INDIA.P. Firstly the price-time series of NSE and SGX is converted into return-time series and Pearson's correlation coefficient is calculated using pandas. We then calculate chi-square value which comes out to close to 0 which suggests that the two variables have a linear relationship and therefore we calculate the equation of the regression line that best fits the data of NSE-SGX percentage return s with a degree of freedom of 248.

Given below is the output and the scatter plot of the NSE returns taken on x-axis and SGX returns taken on y-axis.
